Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This is a basic implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. The player (user) competes against the computer, which randomly selects between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

How to Play
The user is prompted to enter a number:
0 for Rock
1 for Paper
2 for Scissors
The computer will randomly select a number from the same set (0, 1, 2).
The program will then compare the user's input with the computer's input and determine the winner based on the following rules:
Rock beats Scissors.
Scissors beats Paper.
Paper beats Rock.
If both selections are the same, it's a draw.
Game Rules
Rock (0) beats Scissors (2).
Scissors (2) beats Paper (1).
Paper (1) beats Rock (0).
If both the player and the computer choose the same option, it's a draw.
